# Prioritized-Experience-Replay-to-DQNs

Experience replay is a technique that helps online reinforcement learning agents use their memory to remember experiences from the past and enhance their decision-making process from this memory.  Prioritization of this experiences gives a more robust and effective learning system. We have applied the experience replay and prioritized experience replay to deep Q-networks.
